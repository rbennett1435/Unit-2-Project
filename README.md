# Unit 2 Project - _Dungeon Again_

# What is this?

The game that you are looking at is another dungeon crawler, but with better code. Using inspiration from our previous Unit Projects, we wanted to better our code and make a better game. We have the standard movement, inventory, and battles, but we included a way for multiple people to save the game and tweaked the foundation of the code.

# How do you use the program?

When the program starts, the game will allow you to either start anew or load a game. If you do not have a previous save, go ahead and start a new game. With this, you will start creating your character and pick a class. After that, make sure you read the description to see where you can go. Each town leads to a different town, make sure you read what town can go where.

## Are we satisfied with this?

We are. We wish we had more time to add more stuff.

## What would we change?

We would add more items and enemies. We want to add the rest of the dungeons we had planned.
